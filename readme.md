# Work Links

This project is a structure in which you can organize your frequently used links. It also includes a simple search
functionality where you can filter your links.

# How to use?

- Clone the project
- Add your links by following the example provided in the index.html page
- Add the index.html to your bookmarks for easy reference.
- Edit your links whenever necessary.

# Extra notes

This project aimed to work without any server and just a `file:///path/to/file` reference would be more than enough
to consume it in the browser.

# TODOs

- Convert browser bookmarks to this format
- Use Lit-Html to generate html
